# MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering Code of Conduct

## The short version


Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate for ACSE.

If you have a question about the code of conduct or wish to report
misconduct, please email ese-msc-acse@imperial.ac.uk.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not
appropriate.

ACSE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of age, disability, gender race, belief (or lack
thereof), experience or any other dimension of diversity. We do not
tolerate harassment of community members (i.e. students, staff, visitors) in
any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## About the Code of Conduct 

ACSE is dedicated committed to creating a welcoming and supportive
environment for all of our members. All participants in our events and
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. This Code
of Conduct should be honoured by everyone who participates in ACSE.

This Code of Conduct outlines our behaviour expectations as members of ACSE,
both offline and online. Everyone’s participation is contingent upon
following these guidelines in all activities associated with ACSE including
but not limited to:

* Lecturers, tutorials, conferences, workshops, and webinars
* Email lists and online forums like Teams, Slack, Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn
* Representing ACSE at public events

The ACSE Code of Conduct committee is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct
and all reports about misconduct will be dealt with promptly and in
accordance with the Enforcement Manual.

Behaviours that are disrespectful to our members, or intimidate, exclude or
cause discomfort to others will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate
discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are
not limited to, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil
partnership, pregnancy and parenthood, race, religion or belief (or lack
thereof), gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, technical
choices, experience level or any other dimension of diversity.

The ACSE programme committee is responsible for the enforcement of this Code
of Conduct and for dealing with misconduct or violations to this policy.
Trustees, conference chairs, and workshop facilitators are expected to assist
with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct in their respective capacities.
By participating in ACSE, individuals indicate their acceptance of the
procedures by which the ACSE resolves any Code of Conduct incidents.

## Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show
respect and courtesy to others and all interactions should be professional,
both online and in-person.

The following kinds of behaviours in all ACSE events and platforms are encouraged:

* Focussing on what is best for the ACSE community
* Showing courtesy and respect towards every member of the community
* Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Adhering to the Code of Conduct
* Being direct, but professional
* Asking for consent and respecting people’s boundaries
* Being aware of the dynamics of power and privilege (be mindful of how much time and space you are taking up)

## Unacceptable behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* Publication of private communication without consent
* Excessive swearing
* Improper gestures
* Use of stereotypes
* Incitement to violence, suicide or self-harm
* Sustained disruptions of talks, workshops events or communications
* The display of violent images
* Causing someone to fear for their safety through stalking, following, intimidation, or threatening
* Unwelcome and repeated flirtations, propositions, advances, or other sexual attention – including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
* Non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being explicitly asked to stop
* Offensive, insulting, derogatory, or degrading remarks
* Demands for sexual favours in exchange for favourable or preferential treatment
* Advocating for, or encouraging any of the above behaviours

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected
to comply immediately. This applies to any event or platform, either online
or in-person. If an event participant engages in behaviour that violates this
code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the
event or platform, or engage the committee to investigate the Code of Conduct
violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident reporting guidelines

If you believe that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report
this in a timely manner. Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of the
community for everyone. The committee takes reports of misconduct very
seriously and is committed to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature
of our community.

**All reports will be kept confidential.**

Any violations to the Code of Conduct during Society events should be
immediately reported to the event host, organiser or the designated incident
person/people. The people handling the incident report should also make a
direct report to the Code of Conduct committee by emailing to
ese-msc-acse@imperial.ac.uk. If you are uncomfortable emailing to the Code of
Conduct email, incidents can also be reported directly to any of the
committee members using the email addresses published in this document (see
the code of conduct committee section).

If the violation occurs in an online space, reports should be emailed
directly to ese-msc-acse@imperial.ac.uk.

All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.

In your report, please do your best to include:

* Your contact information
* Identifying information of the reported person 
* The behaviour associated with the Code of Conduct violation
* If possible, where the Code of Conduct violation happened
* The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved or that witnessed the incident
* If there is a publicly available record (i.e. email thread, Teams or messages, Twitter threads)
* If you believe this is an ongoing situation, please let us know
* Any additional helpful information

## What to do if someone is in physical danger?

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please ask a committee member,
staff member or volunteer to contact appropriate emergency responders. All
event organizers should, before the event, determine who would be appropriate
to contact in case of an incident and make sure this information is available
at all times over the duration of the event in question.

Once the incident has been resolved, we ask that it be reported to the Code of Conduct committee in the same way as all other incidences.

## Enforcement manual
This is the enforcement manual followed by the ACSE Code of Conduct
committee. It is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we are
consistent and fair on every instance. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct
should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

## The Code of Conduct committee
All responses to report of conduct violations will be managed by the Code of
Conduct committee, which is designated by the course director and should be
comprised of at least three members.

The current Code of Conduct committee is formed of Gareth Collins
(g.collins@imperial.ac.uk), James Pervical (j.percival@imperial.ac.uk),
Adriana Paluszny (apaluszn@imperial.ac.uk), Saskia Goes
(s.goes@imperial.ac.uk), Gareth Roberts (gareth.roberts@imperial.ac.uk) and
Lorraine Craig (l.craig@imperial.ac.uk).

## How will the committee respond to reports?
When a report is sent to the Code of Conduct committee they will reply to the
report to confirm receipt within 24 hours. If a report does not contain
enough information, the committee will attempt to obtain all relevant data
before acting, including contacting any individuals involved to get a
comprehensive account of events. Once a report has been filed one of the
committee members will be assigned as the main acting member responsible for
any communications with the involved individual(s) and the Society trustees.

The Code of Conduct committee is also empowered to act if any of its members
becomes aware of ongoing behaviour that, taken as a whole over a long time
period, is disrupting or harassing. Such behaviour might not be “over the
line” in any single incident, and thus may not generate a report.

## Immediate response
The initial response to an incident is very important. Depending on the severity and details of the incident, an immediate response  may be required. 

In situations involving physical danger or involving a threat to anyone’s
safety, any member of the Code of Conduct committee may – and should – act
immediately to protect the safety of the individual(s) in such situation.
This can include contacting law enforcement or crisis resources.

In situations where an individual committee member acts immediately, they
must inform the other committee members as soon as possible, and report their
actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.

## Ongoing incidents
If the action is ongoing, whether in person or online, any committee member
may act immediately and employ any of the tools available to the community
member to diffuse the situation including bans and blocks. In situations
where an individual committee member acts immediately, they must inform the
other committee members as soon as possible, and report their actions to the
committee for review within 24 hours.

## Less-urgent situations

Once a report is filed, the committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* Whether this is an ongoing situation
* Whether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
* Who, if anyone, was the bad actor
* Whether any communications should be made to the wider community

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The Code of Conduct committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within one week. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that
time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and
projected timeline for resolution.

# Resolutions
The Code of conduct committee must agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question. If the committee cannot reach a consensus over the one week period, this matter will be presented to all of the Society trustees for a final resolution.

Possible outcomes may include:

* Taking no further action (if it is determined that there was no violation).
* A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the Director will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the committee.
* Ending a talk that violates the Code of Conduct early
* A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred.
* Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the individual(s) hold(s).
* An imposed suspension from the programme platforms. The course director will communicate this suspension to the individual(s). They’ll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don’t agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation. Where this impacts on teaching and learning, the individual will be refered to relevant [college procedures for student and staff discipline](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/governance/academic-governance/academic-policy/complaints-appeals-and-discipline/).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all ACSE spaces.
* Supporting the complainant in reporting to other bodies, for example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement agencies.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Code of
Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected
parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this
resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the
committee is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally the committee will make a report to the course director. The Code of
Conduct committee will never publicly discuss the details of the issue; all
public statements will be made by the Society Chair.

## Conflicts of interests
In the event of any conflict of interest (a committee member, their family
member, or someone with whom the committee member has a close academic or
employment relationship is involved in a complaint), the committee member
must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if
necessary.
