# ACSE Code of Conduct

## Introduction

One of the goals in establishing this MSc programme is to encourage the computational science community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you and hope you will welcome others. During this MSc course we hope everyone finds their experiences welcoming, encouraging and rewarding. We want to foster a community based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement and we ask that everyone respect these principles.

The ACSE course community brings together people from multiple histories and cultures, and for the new academic year many of us will be interacting remotely. This brings both benefits and dangers. We expect everyone, both teachers and students, to behave courteously and respectfully to each other. In line with other organisations such as the [Society of Research Software Engineers](https://society-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/), we have enumerated these ideas in the following code of conduct:

## The Code

- I will be kind and respectful to others and assume their good faith in return.
- I will not assume consent and will respect other people's boundaries and privacy.
- I will do my best to be inclusive of others in my words and actions.
- I will accept constructive criticism in the spirit it is intended.
- I will give credit to the work of others.
- I will remember that I represent Imperial Colllege's values of excellence, integrity and courage in a global community.
- I will ensure that my communications are appropriate for a working environment.
- Where it is safe for me to do so, I will intervene when I observe negative or unacceptable behaviour in others.

## Reporting Misconduct

Members who are asked to stop inappropriate behaviour should comply immediately. If violations cannot be dealt with immediately and to all parties satisfaction, they can be reported to any member of teaching staff, preferably as soon as possible. Where appropriate, include contact information for all parties and witnesses along with any other useful information.
