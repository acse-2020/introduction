<h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#consequences-of-unacceptable-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected
to comply immediately. This applies to any event or platform, either online
or in-person. If an event participant engages in behaviour that violates this
code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the
event or platform, or engage the committee to investigate the Code of Conduct
violation and impose appropriate sanctions.</p>

<div class="section" id="incident-reporting-guidelines">
<h2>Incident reporting guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#incident-reporting-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you believe that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report
this in a timely manner. Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of the
community for everyone. The committee takes reports of misconduct very
seriously and is committed to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature
of our community.</p>
<p><strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong></p>
<p>Any violations to the Code of Conduct during Society events should be
immediately reported to the event host, organiser or the designated incident
person/people. The people handling the incident report should also make a
direct report to the Code of Conduct committee by emailing to
ese-msc-acse&#64;imperial.ac.uk. If you are uncomfortable emailing to the Code of
Conduct email, incidents can also be reported directly to any of the
committee members using the email addresses published in this document (see
the code of conduct committee section).</p>
<p>If the violation occurs in an online space, reports should be emailed
directly to ese-msc-acse&#64;imperial.ac.uk.</p>
<p>All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>In your report, please do your best to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your contact information</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying information of the reported person</p></li>
<li><p>The behaviour associated with the Code of Conduct violation</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, where the Code of Conduct violation happened</p></li>
<li><p>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)</p></li>
<li><p>The circumstances surrounding the incident</p></li>
<li><p>Other people involved or that witnessed the incident</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a publicly available record (i.e. email thread, Teams or messages, Twitter threads)</p></li>
<li><p>If you believe this is an ongoing situation, please let us know</p></li>
<li><p>Any additional helpful information</p></li>

<h2>What to do if someone is in physical danger?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-do-if-someone-is-in-physical-danger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you believe someone is in physical danger, please ask a committee member,
staff member or volunteer to contact appropriate emergency responders. On campus, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/estates-facilities/security/emergency-contacts/">College security</a> provide 24/7 support. All
event organizers should, before the event, determine who would be appropriate
to contact in case of an incident and make sure this information is available
at all times over the duration of the event in question.</p>
<p>Once the incident has been resolved, we ask that it be reported to the Code of Conduct committee in the same way as all other incidences.</p>

<div class="section" id="enforcement-manual">
<h2>Enforcement manual<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcement-manual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the enforcement manual followed by the ACSE Code of Conduct
committee. It is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we are
consistent and fair on every instance. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct
should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.</p>

<h2>The Code of Conduct committee<a class="headerlink" href="#the-code-of-conduct-committee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All responses to report of conduct violations will be managed by the Code of
Conduct committee, which is designated by the course director and should be
comprised of at least three members.</p>
<p>The current Code of Conduct committee is formed of Gareth Collins
(g.collins&#64;imperial.ac.uk), James Percival (j.percival&#64;imperial.ac.uk),
Adriana Paluszny (apaluszn&#64;imperial.ac.uk), Saskia Goes

<h2>How will the committee respond to reports?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-the-committee-respond-to-reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a report is sent to the Code of Conduct committee they will reply to the
report to confirm receipt within 24 hours. If a report does not contain
enough information, the committee will attempt to obtain all relevant data
before acting, including contacting any individuals involved to get a
comprehensive account of events. Once a report has been filed one of the
committee members will be assigned as the main acting member responsible for
any communications with the involved individual(s) and the Society trustees.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct committee is also empowered to act if any of its members
becomes aware of ongoing behaviour that, taken as a whole over a long time
period, is disrupting or harassing. Such behaviour might not be “over the
line” in any single incident, and thus may not generate a report.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="immediate-response">
<h2>Immediate response<a class="headerlink" href="#immediate-response" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The initial response to an incident is very important. Depending on the severity and details of the incident, an immediate response  may be required.</p>
<p>In situations involving physical danger or involving a threat to anyone’s
safety, any member of the Code of Conduct committee may – and should – act
immediately to protect the safety of the individual(s) in such situation.
This can include contacting law enforcement or crisis resources.</p>
<p>In situations where an individual committee member acts immediately, they
must inform the other committee members as soon as possible, and report their
actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ongoing-incidents">
<h2>Ongoing incidents<a class="headerlink" href="#ongoing-incidents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the action is ongoing, whether in person or online, any committee member
may act immediately and employ any of the tools available to the community
member to diffuse the situation including bans and blocks. In situations
where an individual committee member acts immediately, they must inform the
other committee members as soon as possible, and report their actions to the
committee for review within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Less-urgent situations<a class="headerlink" href="#less-urgent-situations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a report is filed, the committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Whether this is an ongoing situation</p></li>
<li><p>Whether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety</p></li>
<li><p>What happened</p></li>
<li><p>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation</p></li>
<li><p>Who, if anyone, was the bad actor</p></li>
<li><p>Whether any communications should be made to the wider community</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within one week. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that
time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and
projected timeline for resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolutions">
<h2>Resolutions<a class="headerlink" href="#resolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Code of conduct committee must agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question. Possible outcomes may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Taking no further action (if it is determined that there was no violation).</p></li>
<li><p>A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the Director will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the committee.</p></li>
<li><p>Ending a talk that violates the Code of Conduct early</p></li>
<li><p>A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the individual(s) hold(s).</p></li>
<li><p>An imposed suspension from the programme platforms. The course director will communicate this suspension to the individual(s). They’ll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don’t agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation. Where this impacts on teaching and learning, the individual will be referred via relevant <a class="reference external" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/governance/academic-governance/academic-policy/complaints-appeals-and-discipline/">college procedures for student and staff discipline</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all ACSE spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Supporting the complainant in reporting to other bodies, for example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement agencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Code of
Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected
parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this
resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the
committee is not required to act on this feedback.</p>
<p>Finally the committee will make a report to the course director. The Code of
Conduct committee will never publicly discuss the details of the issue; all
public statements will be made by the course director.</p>

<h2>Conflicts of interests<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts-of-interests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the event of any conflict of interest (a committee member, their family
member, or someone with whom the committee member has a close academic or
employment relationship is involved in a complaint), the committee member
must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if
necessary.</p>
