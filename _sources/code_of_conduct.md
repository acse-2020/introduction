# Code of Conduct

The ACSE course community brings together people from multiple backgrounds and cultures, and at the start of the new academic year we will be interacting remotely. This brings both benefits and risks. As such, we expect everyone, both staff and students to behave courteously, welcomingly and with respect. In line with other organisations such as the [Society of Research Software Engineers](https://society-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/), we have enumerated these ideas in the following code of conduct:

## The Code

- I will be kind and respectful to others and assume their good faith in return.
- I will not assume consent and will respect other people's boundaries and privacy.
- I will do my best to be inclusive of others in my words and actions.
- I will accept constructive criticism in the spirit it is intended.
- I will remember that I represent the values of Imperial Colllege and that my communications should be appropriate for a working community.
- Where it is safe for me to do so, I will intervene when I observe negative or unacceptable behaviours.

## Reporting Misconduct

Members who are asked to stop inappropriate behaviour should comply immediately. If violations cannot be dealt with immediately and to all parties satisfaction, they can be reported to any member of teaching staff, preferably as soon as possible. Where appropriate, include contact information for all parties and witnesses along with any other useful information.
