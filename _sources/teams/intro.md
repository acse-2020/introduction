# Microsoft Teams

## A collorative communication. meeting and presentation tool

The Applied Computational Science & Engineering MSc uses [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) as its video meeting and instant messaging app. The Teams desktop app is available on Windows, Mac & linux, and the mobile app is available on iOS and Android, with download links available from the links above.

You will need to be added to the ACSE20 Team before you are able to interact with your peers (you can expect this to happen in September), however it may be worth downloading the app beforehand to get used to the interface if you haven't used it previously.
