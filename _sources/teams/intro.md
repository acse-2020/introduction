# Microsoft Teams

## A collorative communication. meeting and presentation tool

The Applied Computational Science & Engineering MSc uses [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) as its video meeting and instant messaging app. The Teams desktop app is available on Windows, Mac & linux, and the mobile app is available on iOS and Android, with download links available from the links above.

You will need to be added to the ACSE20 Team before you are able to interact with your peers (you can expect this to happen in September), however it may be worth downloading the app beforehand to get used to the interface if you haven't used it previously.

### Keyboard commands and shortcuts

Microsoft Teams supports a number of quick commands, of the form `/chat`, `/unread` etc  which can be entered into the search menu at the top of the interface. A full list of possible options will appear when you first type `/`. Some of the most useful are

|Command |Action                     |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|\chat   | Switch to new chat message|
|\unread | List unread notifications |

The app also supports a wide number of keyboard shortcuts. Microsoft provides a list of all possible shortcuts for Windows/Linux [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-for-microsoft-teams-2e8e2a70-e8d8-4a19-949b-4c36dd5292d2#picktab=windows) and for Mac OS [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-for-microsoft-teams-2e8e2a70-e8d8-4a19-949b-4c36dd5292d2#picktab=macOS)
