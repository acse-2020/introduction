# Azure Labs

## Introduction

### What is the Azure Labs service?

[Azure Labs](https://labs.azure.com/) is a Microsoft cloud service which provides a virtual computer laboratory in which virtual machines are available to students at any time and from any location. The virtual machines are created from a template which is configured with all the software needed for a particular class or workshop session, and allows students to work independently of the physical computer they're accessing Labs from, avoiding problems with local software being misconfigured or absent.

Students access the Labs servicing using Remote Dekstop, giving access to the Labs virtual machine either in the form of a windowed application or as a full-screen overlay to give the experience of directly working on the Labs system.

Each module and miniproject in the ACSE course will have an associated Azure Lab, and will be sent an invitation by email before the first session. **The virtual machines allocated to students will be reset (user data NOT retained) between modules**, so it is important that any data students want to retain at the end of each module is securely stored outside the virtual machine. OneDrive is recommended as an easy way to do this, and all Imperial College users will get an Imperial One Drive for this purpose.

## Time and resource limits of Labs use

Virtual Machines provided by Azure Labs need to be started when they are required, and stopped when they are not being used. Students are allocated a set number of running hours when they are invited to a Lab, and are responsible for starting and stopping their virtual machine at the start and end of their work. This is a best-practise habit which is applicable to cloud use in general, in order to minimise running costs.

The allocated time should be sufficient to carry out all the work associated with the module or miniproject, but in exceptional cases extra time may be allocated at a tutor's discretion.

Each virtual machine will typically have four cores, 16GB RAM, and 30GB local storage attached to it for the student's sole use. When working with larger datasets students should be aware of memory and storage limits in particular, and be responsible for monitoring their data and running processes. In particular, any data that needs to be retained after the end of a module or miniproject should be stored in the cloud, off the virtual machine, preferably in the student's Imperial College OneDrive. 

## When and why should you use Azure Labs

Many students will prefer to use their own laptop or desktop computer for work during the ACSE course, but some students may either prefer not to install extra software on their local computer, or not have sufficient administrative rights to do so. Some students may not have sufficent local resources to run the larger course exercises, or may experience problems with their local computer that prevent them from working. 

The Azure Labs service is intended to provide a remote computing option to by-pass all of these issues, and requires only that students have a computer and network connection sufficient to connect to the Labs service using Remote Desktop Protocol. Almost all modern systems should be capable of a Remote Desktop connection, and any connection suitable for live streaming tutor presentations, a prerequisite for participating in the ACSE course, should be capable of handling the associated data requirements for Labs.

Even if you intend to primarily use your local computer for course work, it is recommended that you have a basic familiarity with Labs in case you need it unexpectedly as a back up work environment.
