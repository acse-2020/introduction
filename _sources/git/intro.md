# Git & Github

## Software Version Control & Collaborative development 

[Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (also known
as revision control) systems track changes & updates in files, acting as a
backup and log as well as providing tools to combine independent revisions
into a single version. This allows bugs to be tracked, multiple collaborators
to work on the same code without unduely interfering with each other. In
general version control works best with serial, simple files such as the text
files used as source code in software programming. The ACSE course uses a
tool called [git](https://git-scm.com/) and cloud hosting service called
[GitHub](https://github.com/) as its version control framework.

Amoung other tasks GitHub is used for:
- The distribution and update of teaching materials.
- Organizing students work during practical exercises.
- The distribution and submission of assignments.

Please see the {doc}`./git` and {doc}`./github` pages for more information and resources.
