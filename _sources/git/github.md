# The Github.com Website

[GitHub.com](https://github.com) is a web-based repository and collaboration system for code (and other material) controlled via the [git]() version control system. Owned by Microsoft, it is the home for a large number of open sourcse sowftware projects including:

- `numpy` - a Python numerics package
- `node.js` - a Javascript framework for web applications
- `homebrew` - a Mac package managedr containing popular open source software

On the ACSE course, github is used both to hold teaching materials and as a submission mechanism for assignments. As such, it is important you have a specific github account for your work, even if you have used the service before.

## Creating a new account

_Please note the update to the requested format.

This text is based on the relevant [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). You will need the login ID which Imperial College has issued you.

1. Log out of any existing GitHub accounts.
2. Go to GitHub's [pricing](https://github.com/pricing) page.
3. Select 'Join for Free'.
4. Enter your username as `acse-<your login id>`, so a student with the login `abc2020` would use `acse-abc2020`
5. Pick a secure password matching either of the patterns on the page.
6. Complete the verification puzzle to show you aren't a robot and click 'create account'.
7. You should receive notification that your new accound has been created, as well as a message to allow you to verify your email account. Please do so. If you have problems with this step, see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/verifying-your-email-address).

### Updating your github username

If you followed the old version of these instructions, you can update your GitHub username from [this](https://github.com/settings/admin) settings page. You should also ensure that your college username is linked to your github account on [this](page).
