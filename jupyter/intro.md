# Jupyter Notebooks

## Introduction

A significant proportion of the teaching material for the ACSE course is delivered via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)). This is a web-application supporting a number of programming languages (including Python) which creates, shares and runs files containing a mix of conputer code and free form text.

Notebooks are a popular tool for the teaching of computer programming, as well as being in everyday use in the fields of data science and machine learning.

## Using notebooks

As a web application, Jupyter notebooks run through a web browser. To work you must connect to a notebook server on which your notebook runs. This can be via the web (remote) or running on your own computer (local).

### Remote Servers

On the ACSE course you will be provided with a personal link to a preconfigured notebook server running in the cloud using Microsoft Azure. Until you have access to this, notebooks stored in GitHub can be accessed using a service called BinderHub.

### Local Servers

To run Jupyter locally, we recommend a Python distribution called Anaconda. See {doc}`software/intro` for installation instructions. Once it is installed, Jupyter can easily be started via the start menu (on Windows) from the Anaconda navigator, or from the command line.
