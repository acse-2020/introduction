# Computing Equipment

## Introduction

As you know, your new MSc programme is computer based and as such you will require a laptop to complete your studies on campus once in person teaching starts. This page lists a recommended minimum specification for this machine


The first term will have teaching sessions run remotely and includes significant use of cloud resources. This somewhat reduces performance requirements for this portion, but places a premium on a high quality, stable internet connection, as well as needing a  computer meeting the minimum standards for Microsoft Teams.

## Internet Connectivity

During the period of remote tuition, an internet connection will be required. Connectivity with minimum download speeds above 7 Mbps  on your device is strongly recommended _as measured on your device_, while values above 10 Mbps are likely to give a noticably better user experience.

Be aware that advertised broadband speeds are often typical values, rather than minimum guarantees, and that if you are sharing your connection with other users, then the total performance required will scale appropriately. Websites such as [speeedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net) allow you to test the speed of your current connection.

## Minimum Laptop Specification

Please note that the minimum recommended specification for a suitable laptop for the in person course is

- 8th Generation Intel i5 Processor (or AMD Ryzen 5)
- 8GB DDR4 RAM
- 128GB SSD drive
- 802.11ac Wireless adapter

As mentioned elsewhere, for remote tution an adequate experience while using Microsoft Teams ideally needs 8GB RAM and a dual core processor, which is slightly lower than the above specification.

## Useful Additional Equipment

A suitable internet connected computer with a working microphone is a necessity for your participation on the course. However there are some additional items of equipment which you may wish to consider 

- A reasonable quality microphone will be needed during the period of remote working. It is strongly recommended that if possible this be part of a combined microphone-headset, rather than a built-in microphone, both for your own privacy and for improved sound quality during group discussion.

- A high definition webcam is also strongly recommended during group work and study groups.

- Those working on desktops with small screens, or on their laptops will find  a second screen such as a monitor, HDMI enabled TV, or a mid market tablet useful for following lecturers while working on exercises during tutorials, but this will never be an absolute requirement.


## Hardship Support

We recognise that purchasing new computer equipment can represent a significant up front cost (in the UK a suitable laptop meeting these minimum recommended specifications is likely to cost at least Â£500 when purchased new) and that changes in circumstance may make this impossible for some students. Those experiencing significant hardship should may want to apply to [the College Student Support Fund](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/fees-and-funding/financial-assistance/student-support-fund/) for help covering the cost of a laptop (see the Laptop Support Fund section). The Fund is now considering applications from students in their first term of study, due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 response.
