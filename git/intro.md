# Git & Github

## Software Version Control & Collaborative development 

Version control (also known as revision control) systems track changes & updates in files, acting as a backup and log as well as providing tools to combine independent revisions into a single version. This allows bugs to be tracked, multiple collaborators to work on the same code without unduely interfering with each other.

In general version control works best with serial, simple files such as the text files used as source code in software programming. The ACSE course uses a tool called `git` and cloud hosting service called GitHub as its version control framework. Amoung other tasks this is used for:

- The distribution and update of teaching materials.
- Organizing students work during practical exercises.
- The distribution and submission of assignments.

Please see the {doc}`./git` and {doc}`./github` pages for more information and resources.
