# The `git` version control system

## Introduction

The `git` tool is a popular version control system originally authored by Linus Tolvalds, the creator of the first Linux kernel. It is free, open source software and supports a distributed development paradigm in which many (tens or hundreds) of groups or users can independently develop the same package without impacting on each other's work.

Although extremely powerful, `git` can be intimidating for new users. Practice is strongly recommended before the course begins.

## Installation

Git is preinstalled on Mac OS X and many popular Linux distributions. Windows users should see {./software/intro} for our recommended instructions on installing the git command line tools.

## Software Carpentry Lectures

Students should complete the [Software Carpentry tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) on `git`.
