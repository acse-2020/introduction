# The Command Line

```{index} command line
```

## Introduction

Modern numerical programming involves significant time spent interacting with consoles and command line interfaces, shells and prompts. This can be remotely, when connecting to large computing clusters or locally when running programs with text based interfaces for configuration, input or output.

## Software Carpentry Teaching Materials

While the ACSE course provides introductory lectures in programming, you will find it greatly beneficial to work through the following [Software Carpentry lecture](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) on the the Bash shell. This has examples working in a Mac file system, but can also be attempted on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (see {doc}`../software/intro`)

## Practice Test

A short practice test covering the above content is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=B3WJK4zudUWDC0-CZ8PTB4qR9JGVtINFlo44s7bAHYhUOVpSRUtPRE0wOTlQSTFXWjAzMlRUVVg2Mi4u). It can be completed in under 15 minutes.

- A [beginners tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/powershell-tutorial.html) on Powershell, one of the two command line interfaces common on Windows machines.
- A [beginners tutorial](https://techtipvault.com/windows/command-prompt-windows-10-cmd-guide/) on the command prompt, the other common CLI on Windows.
