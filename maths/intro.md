# Mathematics

The course will assume a certain background level of mathematics. Key topics that the course will build on are Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus and Partial Differential Equations. If you are unfamiliar with any of these topics or it has been a while since you used them, you may find the following resources useful to get up to speed before the course starts:

1. Imperial Metric is an online interactive Maths resource aimed at first-year undergraduates, but it may be useful for brushing up on topics learned some time ago. The resource can be accessed [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/staff/ed-tech/metric/).

    We recommend reviewing any of the following topics that you do not feel confident with:

    - Differential Equations
    - Differentiation
    - Integration
    - Partial Differentiation
    - Numerical Methods
    - Vectors
    - Matrices
    - Statistics and Probability

2. A concise set of lecture notes introducing Vector Calculus and PDEs from the UG maths courses in the Deptartment of Earth Science and Engineering are available for download [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/v/ESE-ACSE-MSc-Pre-sessional)

3. More general mathematics materials for all years of undergraduate tuition from the Earth Science and Engineering department at Imperial College are available [here](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/mathematics/intro.html). Many of these notes also provide programming examples in Python.

## Practice Test

A short practice test covering the above content is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=B3WJK4zudUWDC0-CZ8PTB4qR9JGVtINFlo44s7bAHYhUMk1TSUNLODBHSlhYRVpQRk9CRFpIS0hXWC4u). It can be completed in under 15 minutes.
