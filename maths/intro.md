# Mathematics

The course will assume a certain background level of maths. Key topics that the course will build on are Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus and Partial Differential Equations. If you are unfamiliar with these topics or it has been a while since you used them, you may find the following resources useful:

1. Imperial Metric is an online interactive Maths resource aimed at first-year undergraduates, but it may be useful for brushing up on topics learned some time ago. The resource can be accessed [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/staff/ed-tech/metric/).

    We recommend reviewing any of the following topics that you do not feel confident with:

    - Differential Equations
    - Differentiation
    - Integration
    - Partial Differentiation
    - Numerical Methods
    - Vectors
    - Matrices
    - Statistics and Probability

2. A concise set of lecture notes introducing Vector Calculus and PDEs from the UG maths courses in the Dept. Earth Science and Engineering are available for download [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/v/ESE-ACSE-MSc-Pre-sessional)

3. Presessional mathematics materials from the Earth Science and Engineering department are available [here](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/mathematics/intro.html).
